# Vehicles

{rules}

Vehicles are the gas-powered motor devices used by nearly all travellers to move down [The Beltway] and get between [buildings]. They are essential tools for transportation, storage, housing, and escape. Without vehicles, getting between [buildings] is practically impossible due to the dangers of [The Veering] along the road. Each [vehicle|Vehicles] used by the party must be driven by a member *(see the [Exhaustion|Characters] rules for more info)*.

## Statistics

**Frame:** *(1-20 strength)* The durability of the machine. How much it can be smashed, dented, burned, or bent before it becomes unusable.

**Torque:** *(km/h)* The maximum speed of the machine. Smaller vehicles will naturally be faster, but at the cost of other stats.

**Tank:** *(litres)* The maximum amount of gasoline that the machine can hold. This will deplete throughout the day

**Mileage:** *(litres/100km)* The amount of gasoline consumed. Weight, types of fuel, and other accessories may affect this.

Should your vehicle become damaged in some way *(e.g. a car crash, sabotage, engine fire, etc.)*, your **TC** may indicate a decrease in one or more of its statistics. Should its **Frame**, **Torque**, or **Tank** reach less than or equal to that **statistic**'s starting value, the vehicle becomes un-driveable.
