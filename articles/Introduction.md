# Introduction

**Beltway** is an alternate-fantasy TTRPG system and campaign setting. It takes place along an infinite stretch of highway asphalt, populated by unique variations of classic fantasy races, and menaced on either side by dense, dangerous forests. Life on the road is precarious and tied to [vehicles|Vehicles], food, and rest. [The Veering] sends its [Beasts] out to hunt, kept at bay only by strenuous [Wards] and continual movement down the road. Each traveller has their own reasons for carrying on down [The Beltway], some personal, some religious, some familial, and some simply for survival.

The [culture|Dialect Guide] of [The Beltway] is one that consists of perpetual travel, punctuated by encounters with others on the road, nightly stops, the dangers of the forest, and other chance occurrences. Groups tend to be way of each other, but ultimately face the unnatural danger that is [The Veering] and its consequences.

See the [Dialect Guide] for more info about the etymology of various slang words and [Angel|Angels] names.
