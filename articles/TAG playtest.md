> **Roleplay**
> The party pulls into a motel for the night. There are many people packed in tonight. Some of the customers include:
> - An Orcish repair crew, sitting quietly in the corner. They get free drinks from the bar all night.
> - A Halfling caravan set up behind the motel, telling stories and singing songs.
> - A shady-looking Human, looking to steal the Ward's relic.
> - The Elvish bartender, looking to trade engine parts (or gamble for them).

> **Exploration**
> The party has failed to find a place to stay for the night, and have instead camped the night in an abandoned amusement park. The wards are still active, and while Beasts can now enter them, they become docile when they do. The party is awoken by a Moose Beast who has wandered into the park.
