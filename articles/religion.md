Religion along [The Beltway] is practiced in many forms, as it's difficult for information to disseminate or transform when constantly on the move. While no main practices or services are performed, a great majority of travellers have some basic belief in [Angels], [Wards], and [Parkade]. For those who do seek a greater level of religious involvement, certain [Elven|Elves]-run [Attractions] serve a more devotional purpose than the standard [Motels], [Mechanics], and [Gas stations].
