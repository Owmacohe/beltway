# Halflings

{races}

Bumbling Halflings are generally the most tolerated by other travellers of [The Beltway]. Unable to engage in physical combat, their armoured [RVs] serve as protection against attacks from both [Beasts] and other travellers alike. To even further discourage looting, many who pass their slow-moving vehicles are often given a toll of food or supplies. Halflings live in large groups of 4-8 inside their [RVs], and will park end-to-end with others when stationed overnight at [motels|Motels].
