# Parkade

{religion,The Beltway}

The fantastical, imagined end to the infinite road of [The Beltway]. Wrapped up in the mythos of [Angels] and [Beasts], Parkade acts as a magical, yet constantly unattainable goal for travellers along the way. Described as a vast, quiet parking lot nestled into the clouds, it symbolises a place where [vehicle|Vehicles] engines can finally be turned off for good. To many, it is nothing but a false dream of those who spend too long behind the wheel, but to others it is a way of life, an approaching horizon, a light in the thick wooded darkness.
