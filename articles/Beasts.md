# Beasts

{The Veering}

The blank-eyed creatures that emerge from the woods at the behest of [The Veering], calling travellers to their doom and attempting to jump in front of [vehicles|Vehicles]. All manner of Beasts have the ability to produce haunting an unnaturally rythmic vibrations from their mouths, not unlike the chirping cries of cicadas. This monotonous noise that echoes from their throats has the ability to put those who hear it under a hazy trace, causing them to drive their [vehicles|Vehicles] off the road. Beasts will often appear to travellers stranded at the side of [The Beltway] during the day, and may even venture onto the road at night, causing accidents.

It is said that travellers who are [Veered|The Veering] off the road eventually become beasts, each with differing levels of sentience. Lower caste Beasts exhibit many classic cervine traits, and are essentially puppeted animals. Higher caste Beasts however may exhibit stranger, more intelligent behavious, and may even be able to speak on rare occasions. Needless to say, they are extremely dangerous.
