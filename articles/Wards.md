# Wards

{religion,The Veering}

Wards are unseen magical barriers that draw upon wellsprings that crop up along the sides of [The Beltway]. They are harnessed and shaped by [Elves] to house their [buildings] and provide lodging for travellers that come along. Wards are not indestructible, and wear over time. Uninterrupted heavy use will slowly decrease their potency. Individuals who bring parts of the forest *(e.g. rocks, twigs, etc.)* within Wards may also weaken them, often quite drastically.

A common practice by most [Elves] who manage Wards is the inspection and light interrogation of all who enter their establishments. Questions regarding trustworthiness, [vehicle|Vehicles] contents, and levels of exhaustion are commonplace prior to being allowed entrance. This precaution is due to the importance of both the Wards' literal and perceived protection. All patrons who enter are expected to retain a certain level of non-aggression for the safety of all who reside there, especially overnight. Stories of Wards that succumb to internal strife and lose their protective properties always conclude with [Beastly|Beasts] overrun and mass [Veering|The Veering].

Each Ward has a central object which acts as its epicenter. Often, this is the relic of an [Angel|Angels] *(e.g. an eye, a feather, a patch of skin, etc.)*, though it doesn't have to be. Nevertheless, this object is its most vulnerable part, and will be kept secret, contained, or both.
