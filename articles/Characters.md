## Statistics

Player characters are first chosen from one of the playable [races]. This race determines their susceptibility to [The Veering] *(see the Veering article for more info)*, as well as a few modifications to their character's **statistics**. To determine your character's initial **statistics**, simply roll **1d20** for each of the four described below. When rolling these first **statistics**, the minimum amount is 5, and the maximum amount is 15. *(e.g. a player who rolls 3 for **STRN** would instead set that score to 5, but a player who rolls 12 for **WISD** would just set that score to 12)*. To make a skill check, roll **1d20** and compare it to the appropriate **statistic** (at your **TC**'s discretion). To succeed, the result must be less than or equal to the **statistic**.

- **Strength (STRN):** Your character's physical muscle strength. Their capacity to lifting, pushing, and smashing.
- **Dexterity (DEXT):** Your character's physical speed and manoeuvrability. Their capacity for throwing, jumping, and dancing.
- **Wisdom (WISD):** Your character's mental practicality. Their capacity for common sense, deception, and comedy.
- **Intelligence (INTL):** Your character's mental acuteness. Their capacity for recollection, repair, and truth.

[Elves] have a fifth **statistic**, described below. It is determined in the same manner as the previous ones.

- **Magic (MAGI):** Your character's intangible magical power. Their capacity for creating [Wards], evading [Beasts], and interpreting dreams.

On top of your rolls for each **statistic**, each [race|races] gets certain additional bonuses, described below:

- **[Humans]:** +2 to **DEXT** and **INTL**.
- **[Halflings]:** +2 to **DEXT** and **WISD**.
- **[Elves]:** +2 to **INTL** and **MAGI**.
- **[Dwarves]:** +2 to **STRN** and **WISD**.
- **[Orcs]:** +2 to **STRN** and **DEXT**.

## Wounds

**Beltway** has no statistic for 'hit points', and instead employs a wound system. At your **TC**'s discretion, characters may receive **temporary** or **permanent** wounds as the result of fights, falls, [vehicle|Vehicle] crashes, etc. These wounds may impact any of your **statistics**, only certain skill checks, something else entirely, or nothing at all. Here are a few examples:

- A broken leg makes it harder to run, and you walk with a limp
- A deep cut on your hand is sore, and will leave a scar
- Head trauma makes it hard to look at bright lights for a few days, and will make you forgetful later in life
- Long exposure to gasoline fumes might temporarily make you sick

After a significant number of wounds, your **TC** may indicate that your character is some number of wounds away from death, usually between 1-3.

## Exhaustion

Finally, your character has a level of **exhaustion**. This score increases and decreases over time, usually at the discretion of your **TC**. Some examples may include:

- A particularly stressful standoff between your party and the proprietor of a [building|buildings] might result in everyone getting a 1/2 point of **exhaustion**.
- Staying up at night *(e.g. to watch for [Beasts] when stranded at the side of [The Beltway])* results in 1 point of **exhaustion** per three hours.
- Driving a [vehicle|Vehicles] results in 1 point of exhaustion per four hours (this is compounded with the above increase when driving at night).
- Hearing the call of a [Beast|Beasts] results in some amount of **exhaustion**:
   - 0 for [Orcs]
   - 1/2 for [Dwarves]
   - 1 for [Elves]
   - 1 and 1/2 for [Halflings]
   - 2 for [Humans]
- Characters who are more exhausted than others may also receive additional points of **exhaustion** upon hearing such a call.
- Certain higher caste [Beasts] may also impose more **exhaustion** upon characters with special actions, at the **TC**'s discretion.

At 5 **exhaustion**, certain basic tasks like short term memory recollection, staying awake, and balance may become difficult (this is treated as a **temporary wound**). From 6 to 8 **exhaustion**, your character may receive a **permanent wound** in the form of long-term insomnia or organ failure. At 9 **exhaustion**, your character enters a coma of fatigue, and requires immediate medical aid. At 10 **exhaustion**, your character dies.

**Exhaustion** is reduced primarily by sleeping, at a rate of 1 point per 2 hours of sleep. Leisure activities and joyful experiences also have the ability to reduce this in minor amounts (once again, at your **TC**'s discretion).
