# Characters

{rules}

Player characters are first chosen from one of the playable [races]. This race determines their susceptibility to [The Veering] *(see the Veering article for more info)*, as well as a few modifications to their character's **statistics**. To determine your character's initial **statistics**, simply roll **1d20** for each of the four described below. When rolling these first **statistics**, the minimum amount is 5, and the maximum amount is 15. *(e.g. a player who rolls 3 for **STRN** would instead set that score to 5, but a player who rolls 12 for **WISD** would just set that score to 12)*. To make a skill check, roll **1d20** and compare it to the appropriate **statistic** (at your **TC**'s discretion). To succeed, the result must be less than or equal to the **statistic**.

- **Strength (STRN):** Your character's physical muscle strength. Their capacity to lifting, pushing, and smashing.
- **Dexterity (DEXT):** Your character's physical speed and manoeuvrability. Their capacity for throwing, jumping, and dancing.
- **Wisdom (WISD):** Your character's mental practicality. Their capacity for common sense, deception, and comedy.
- **Intelligence (INTL):** Your character's mental acuteness. Their capacity for recollection, repair, and truth.

[Elves] have a fifth **statistic**, described below. It is determined in the same manner as the previous ones.
- **Magic (MAGI):** Your character's intangible magical power. Their capacity for creating [Wards], evading [Beasts], and interpreting dreams.

**Beltway** has no statistic for 'hit points', and instead employs a wound system. At your **TC**'s discretion, characters may receive **temporary** or **permanent** wounds as the result of fights, [vehicle|Vehicle] crashes, etc. These wounds may impact any of your **statistics**, only certain skill checks, something else entirely, or nothing at all. Here are a few examples:
- A broken leg makes it harder to run, and you walk with a limp
- A deep cut on your hand is sore, and will leave a scar
- Head trauma makes it hard to look at bright lights for a few days, and will make you forgetful later in life
- Long exposure to gasoline fumes might temporarily make you sick

After a significant number of wounds, your **TC** might indicate that your character is some number of wounds away from death, usually between 1-3.
