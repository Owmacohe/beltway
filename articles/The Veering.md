# The Veering

{rules}

The strange, unnatural force exuded by the woods on either side of [The Beltway]. It draws [people|races] in, veering their [vehicles|Vehicles] off the road, and their minds out of their bodies. Its incomprehensible will is enacted by [Beasts]; fell cervine creatures which attempt to lure witless travellers into the thickness of the trees, never to be seen again. Besides [Beasts], no other fauna is known to live within the forest.

The following is a list of [races]' susceptibilities to The Veering *(from most to lease susceptible)*:
1. [Humans]
2. [Halflings]
3. [Elves]
4. [Dwarves]
5. [Orcs]

Upon hearing the call of a [Beast|Beasts], [Characters] receive **exhaustion**. After this, any characters who have at least 5 **exhaustion** lose control over their executive bodily functions. This often results in individuals 'veering' their cars off into the woods and/or simply walking into them on foot, never to be seen again. Should this occur, your **TC** will ask for a **d20** roll. If this roll is greater than twice your character's **exhaustion**, they are able to resist the call. If not, your character must take the next 2 rounds attempting to veer the car or walk into the woods. This process may be stopped prematurely through physical force or magical influence, but if not, the character is lost to the woods after this time.
