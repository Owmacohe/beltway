# The Veering

{rules}

The strange, unnatural force exuded by the woods on either side of [The Beltway]. It draws [people|races] in, veering their [vehicles|Vehicles] off the road, and their minds out of their bodies. Its incomprehensible will is enacted by [Beasts]; fell cervine creatures which attempt to lure witless travellers into the thickness of the trees, never to be seen again. Besides [Beasts], no other fauna is known to live within the forest.

The following is a list of [races]' susceptibilities to The Veering *(from most to lease susceptible)*:
1. [Humans]
2. [Halflings]
3. [Elves]
4. [Dwarves]
5. [Orcs]

Upon hearing the call of a [Beast|Beasts], [Characters] receive **exhaustion**, and depending on their current level of **exhaustion**, may lose control over their executive bodily functions. This often results in individuals 'veering' their cars off into the woods and/or simple walking into them on foot, never to be seen again. Should this occur, your **TC** will ask for a certain number of **statistics**-based skill checks (see [Characters]) to resist the call.
