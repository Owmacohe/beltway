Its incomprehensible will is enacted by [Beasts]; fell cervine creatures which attempt to lure witless travellers into the thickness of the trees, never to be seen again. Besides [Beasts], no other fauna is known to live within the forest.

The following is a list of [races]' susceptibilities to The Veering (from most to lease susceptible):
1. [Humans]
2. [Halflings]
3. [Elves]
