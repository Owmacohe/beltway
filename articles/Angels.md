# Angels

{religion}

Many travellers along [The Beltway] believe that it was originally built by an ancient race of angelic beings, as an act of mercy and splendour against the [Veering|The Veering] forest. Superstition runs rampant, and accounts of the actual event, its meaning, and Angels' current involvement in the world are extremely varied. However, one popularly-held belief is that [Elvish|Elves] [Wards] are in fact due in part to the fact that they are placed at the resting places of Angels. Many [buildings] (and in particular [Attractions]) lean into this idea, and prominently display angelic 'relics' and 'feathers'. Though many minor Angels are said to have existed, the three most revered are:

1. **Circuguara**, angel of [The Beltway]
2. **Omisciguara**, angel of [Vehicles]
3. **Spalguara**, angel of [Beastly|Best] protection / of [Wards]
