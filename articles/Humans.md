# Humans

{races}

Humans are lean and fast, and comprise about half of all travellers on [The Beltway]. They're common, but rarely congregate in groups of more than two or three. They often travel in [station wagons|Vehicles], and can out-run pretty much anything on foot over long distances (save for some greater [Beasts]).
