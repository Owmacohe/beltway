The **Beltway** system is a TTRPG designed mainly for short-form campaigns. It is lead by a **Traffic Conductor** (*aka* **TC**) (*i.e.* a **Game Master**), and 3-6 players. It relies on dice rolls for random chance at the **TC**'s digression, and has no levelling up or traditionally 'crunchy' mechanics, save for some fuel calculations with [vehicles|Vehicles]. Players design simple [characters|Characters] from one of five [races], choose one or more [vehicles|Vehicles], and set out along [The Beltway].

The only dice used during a game of **Beltway** are **d20**s. To take an action, indicate to your **TC** what your character is intending to do, and your **TC** will ask for one or more **d20** rolls. Sometimes these rolls will be contested by the **TC**'s own **d20** rolls. The dice determine the general result, with a lower score determining a better outcome in the fight. Players are strongly encouraged to embellish their rolls with descriptions of what happens, but the **TC** is the final say on all matters.

Combat occurs in a much more freeform manner than other TTRPGs. There is no set beginning or end to combat, and players may take actions whenever they want, however a player may only take one action and one movement per round. A round is considered complete when all those involved in combat have taken at most one action and/or movement. At this point, a new round begins. This system allows for freeform combat and decision-making, while also allowing for all party members to participate in combat.
