The **Beltway** system is a TTRPG designed mainly for short-form campaigns. It is lead by a **Traffic Conductor** (*aka* **TC**) (*i.e.* a **Game Master**), and 3-6 players. It relies on dice rolls for random chance at the **TC**'s digression, and has no levelling up or traditionally 'crunchy' mechanics, save for some fuel calculations with [vehicles|Vehicles]. Players design simple [characters|Characters] from one of five [races], choose one or more [vehicles|Vehicles], and set out along [The Beltway].

The only dice used during a game of **Beltway** are **d20**s.

Though rarely, combat may occur. In this case, your **TC** will ask for a series of **d20** rolls, contested by their own **d20** rolls. Combat is played is a loose manner. The dice determine the general result, with a higher score determining a better outcome in the fight. Players are strongly encouraged to embellish their rolls with descriptions of what happens, but the **TC** is the final say on all matters (without overruling the dice of course).
